### Welcome to my profile 💕

🔭 I’m a Systems Analysis and Development student transitioning into a developer role.
  
🌱  I’m focusing on study Java and Python through personal projects, and explore HTML and CSS to improve my web development skills.
  
👩‍💻  I currently work as a support engineer, helping customers by debugging issues in applications that use Kubernetes, Apache, and Java — analyzing logs and solving issues is part of my routine.
  
🎯  I have a strong interest in backend, but I’m also curious about other areas, including UX, where I’ve gained some experience.

🌐  I contribute as a UX designer in a volunteer project that supports women’s growth in tech by building a platform to match internal innovation projects with employee volunteers.

### ☕ Fun facts

📚 I’m a former biologist with a master’s in Ecology. My experience with R during research sparked my curiosity for programming and opened the door to tech.

🔎 I’m into reality puzzle shows where people have to solve mysteries to win — stuff like _The Devil’s Game_ and _The Mole_.

🎮 I’m hooked on games that mix collaboration and strategy, like _Valorant_ or a good D&D campaign.
